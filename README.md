# BreakoutClone
Just a one night attempt to make a Breakout Clone

Still learning Unreal Engine 4. This was an attempt to do something 2d in a tight time frame, in case I need to do it for Global Game Jam.  It isn't perfect by any stretch, but Blueprint contiunues to impress me with how quickly it is to devesop in.  I spent most of my time trying to figure out how physics worked in UE4 as I haven't done enough with them yet.

Made with Unreal Engine 4.14.3
